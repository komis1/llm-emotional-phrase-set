# Towards LLM-Generated Affective Phrase Sets for Text Entry Evaluation - Source Code and Data Repository

## Summary
We present a novel method to generate affective phrase sets using Large Language Models (LLMs), for use in text entry study transcription tasks. These phrases could be used to adjust participant emotions, and enable performance assessment under various affective conditions. In this repository we provide the following materials.

## Contents
### /Affective Phrase Generation and Analysis Code/
Two Jupyter Notebooks (Python) to generate affective phrases and to analyse the generated phrases in the valence-arousal space.

### /Affective Phrase Sets/
Two compressed files - one contains a total of 3,600 generated affective phrases, and one contains the phrases we used in our laboratory experiment.

### /Experiment Web App/
Complete source code (HTML/JS/PHP/SQL) to reproduce our experiment environment on your own server. Feel free to use this (or modify it) for any text entry evaluation project.

### /Experiment Data/
All the data collected in our experiment (n=13 participants), in CSV format.
